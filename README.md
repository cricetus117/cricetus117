Need some help ? This is an AES-CBC 256 bits encryption, you can find the IV and the key if you look enough.

Need more help ? When you'll see one of them it'll be quite obvious as they're not words nor sentences. And you should check What I already say about me, links and things like that where I could've written.

Need event more help ? Sorry but I've already helped too much... Trust me, you're not missing anything really important.
